# ForwardKinematics

## Introduction

This is to reconstruct motions of a skeleton from BVH motion capture files.

In this assignment, I read hierarchical structure of the joints, and the relative motions of each part of the skeleton from the BVH file. Then, I compute each joint's position from the motion capture data to reconstruct the motion of the skeleton.
